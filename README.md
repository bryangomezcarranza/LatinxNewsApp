## Description

This is a simple News App done with UIKit. UI is done programmatically, no storyboards. 
App works with - Costum UserDefaults for Persistance and Codable for Network requests. 

### Motivation 

This little project was design to further my practice with programmatic UI. 

### Challenge 

The main challenge of this project was to make eveything work via programmatic UI with no storyboards. Also, the API was not the best as there is only a few news articles related to Latinos and Latinas in the thec world.
