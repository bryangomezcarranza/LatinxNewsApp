## Overview

LatinxNewsApp is a design taken from a bigger idea. It is a news app that fetchs tech news related to Latinos or Latinas in the USA from the Algolia API. This is a simple app that allows you to explore and save news articles. 



## Description

### Motivation 

This little project was design to further my practice with programmatic UI. 

### Challenge 

The main challenge of this project was to make eveything work via programmatic UI with no storyboards. Also, the API was not the best as there is only a few news articles related to Latinos and Latinas in the thec world.
